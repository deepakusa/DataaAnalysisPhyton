My project will be more helpful to make a decision for the working people who are more interested move to a neighborhood, which has good schools and airport facility. The good school district has more value to the neighborhood. if people buy house or invest in real estate that would profit them in long term. \n\n\n\n## Details of the project.\n###### The Data will be using in this project is Foursquare data of couple of City details along with Airport details and School in the same area.
